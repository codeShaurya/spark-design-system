# Spark Design System React

Welcome to the Spark Design System React npm package.

Spark Design System is where we collect our best solutions for how to design and build unified digital experiences for the Rocket brands.

* [Spark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sparkdesignsystem/spark) contains the basic patterns and components that make up
  the visual and interaction design of the Quicken Loans family of
  Fintech products. If your application is expected to look and behave
  like a Quicken Loans application, this package is the starting point.
  When the Spark Sass and JS setup files are imported into an application you will receive code for all of Spark.
